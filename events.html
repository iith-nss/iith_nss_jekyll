              Vidyadaan is an attempt to share knowledge with the children of
              government schools, which will be conducted regularly. The main
              motto is to ensure that the children don't lack basic skills like
              self-introduction in English, simple math, etc. We conduct a few
              activities to teach them concepts instead of regular teaching. We
              also conduct games as an extra activity to cheer them up. This
              event also acts as a stress-reliever for volunteers who get a
              chance to spend time with children.

            the students of nearby villages. It is an event which is conducted
            on Saturdays. Students of IITH teach them many topics with videos
            and ensure that the purpose is being fulfilled. Storytelling and
            other extra-curricular activities are also conducted to brighten
            them. Based on the standards, the students are divided into
            sub-groups, and enough volunteers are assigned to each sub-group for
            maximum efficiency.

            Clothing is one of the basic survival needs. During times of natural
            calamities, many people lack this basic need. NSS IITH organizes
            this event of collecting clothes from students and donating them to
            the people in need. By helping one person, you cannot change the
            whole world, but you can change the world for that one person.

              purpose is being fulfilled. Storytelling and other extra-curricular activities are also conducted to brighten them. 
              Based on the standards, the students are divided into sub-groups and enough volunteers are assigned to each
              sub-group for maximum efficiency.</p>
