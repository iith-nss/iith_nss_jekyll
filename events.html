              Vidyadaan is an attempt to share knowledge with the children of
              government schools, which will be conducted regularly. The main
              motto is to ensure that the children don't lack basic skills like
              self-introduction in English, simple math, etc. We conduct a few
              activities to teach them concepts instead of regular teaching. We
              also conduct games as an extra activity to cheer them up. This
              event also acts as a stress-reliever for volunteers who get a
              chance to spend time with children.

              which is conducted on Saturdays. Students of IITH teach them many topics with the help of videos and ensure that the 
              purpose is being fulfilled. Storytelling and other extra-curricular activities are also conducted to brighten them. 
              Based on the standards, the students are divided into sub-groups and enough volunteers are assigned to each
              sub-group for maximum efficiency.</p>
